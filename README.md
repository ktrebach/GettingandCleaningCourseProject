===============================
This repository contains three files: this README markdown file, an R script, run_analysis.R, and a Codebook markdown file.
The R script takes raw data on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones and creates a tidy data set of the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. The codebook contains more description on the raw data, the processed data, and the steps to get from raw to processed.

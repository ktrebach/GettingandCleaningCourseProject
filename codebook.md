Example three, technical mechanics

we might want to make a codebook for Anderson's Iris data data(iris)

we might read the documentation http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/datasets/html/iris.html

we might investigate the structure and the summary info with str and summary

we might look up how to do markdown formatting https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics

we could the file menu in RStudio (or any other text editor) to make a new text file and save it as codebook.md (confident that when we move it onto github, it will display the formatting we put in as text codes)

then we write it, if for example we decide we want our entries about the variables to have bullet points we put a * and a space at the start of each paragraph separated by a blank line

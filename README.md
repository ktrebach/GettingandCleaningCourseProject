===============================
This repository contains four files: 
* this **README** markdown file, 
* an R script called 'run_analysis.R',  
* a codebook markdown file,
* the second tidy data set called 'HARMeans.txt'.

The **R script** uses raw data on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones to create a tidy data set of all mean and standard deviations feature variables and to create a second tidy data set of the average of each feature variable by each activity - subject combination. Both tidy data sets meet the principles discussed in the course:  1) each variable is in one column, 2) each observation is in one row, and each table stores data about one kind of observation.  

The **codebook** contains more description on the raw data, the processed data, and the steps to get from raw to processed. 

The **second tidy** data set is provided as well.

===============================
This repository contains four files: 
* this README markdown file, 
* an R script called 'run_analysis.R',  
* a codebook markdown file,
* the second tidy data set.

The R script uses raw data on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones to create a tidy data set of all mean and standard deviations feature variables and to create a second tidy data set of the average of each feature variable by each activity - subject combination. The codebook contains more description on the raw data, the processed data, and the steps to get from raw to processed. The second tidy data set is provided as well.
